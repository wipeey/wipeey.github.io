## Introduction

When I first saw the assignment to build a portable web radio, I was both excited and daunted. Combining microcontroller programming, audio processing, and networking felt like threading a needle through multiple disciplines. Over the course of several weeks, I went from prototype sketches on breadboards to a polished device that streams live radio stations, complete with remote-control capabilities. In this detailed account, I share what I learned, the challenges I faced, and the pride of hearing my own creation come to life.

## 1. Conceptualization & Planning

Before soldering any wires, I sketched a block diagram detailing the ESP32’s connections to the VS1053 codec, power supply, and user interface (buttons, LEDs). Researching similar projects on GitHub and the Adafruit forums helped me outline key features:

* **Wi-Fi-based streaming** rather than local SD playback.
* **Physical controls**: buttons for station navigation, volume, and EQ.
* **Dynamic network configuration**: avoid hard-coding SSIDs.
* **Remote triggers via MQTT** for smartphone control.

Sketching on paper saved me hours of rework later.

## 2. Hardware Exploration

### 2.1 ESP32 Feather Details

The **Adafruit HUZZAH32** Feather’s compact form factor and LiPo charger made it ideal:

* **Pins**: 21 GPIOs, two analog inputs, hardware UARTs, I²C bus.
* **Power**: Micro-USB or 3.7 V LiPo battery input.
* **Peripherals**: Integrated 2.4 GHz radio and BLE.

I spent an afternoon wiring the Feather to a breadboard, toggling the user LED and reading the reset button, establishing a basic loop:

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(0, INPUT_PULLUP); // Boot button
}
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, !digitalRead(0));
  delay(200);
}
```

This confirmed my environment was solid.

### 2.2 VS1053 & Music Maker FeatherWing

Adafruit’s **Music Maker FeatherWing** includes the VS1053 codec, headphone amp, and microSD slot. Key insights:

* The **SCI** bus (pins XCS, XDCS, DREQ) controls codec registers.
* The **SDI** bus (MOSI, SCK) streams MP3 data.
* **DREQ** line indicates buffer ready—critical for flow control.

I wired each pin to specific GPIOs on the Feather and practiced reading the device ID register:

```cpp
uint16_t id = musicPlayer.readRegister(SCI_STATUS);
Serial.printf("VS1053 Status: 0x%04X\n", id);
```

## 3. Software Setup & Core Sketch

### 3.1 Arduino IDE Configuration

Installing support for the ESP32 required adding `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json` to **Preferences → Additional Boards Manager URLs**. Then:

1. **Boards Manager** → install **esp32** by Espressif Systems.
2. Reboot IDE and select **Adafruit ESP32 Feather** under **Tools → Board**.
3. Verify upload speed at **921600** for fast flashing.

### 3.2 Library Integration

I installed via **Library Manager**:

* **Adafruit VS1053** for codec control.
* **ESP32\_VS1053\_Stream** for HTTP streaming.
* **WiFiManager** by tzapu.
* **PubSubClient** by Nick O’Leary.

### 3.3 Basic Audio Streaming Sketch

My first working code used `ESP32_VS1053_Stream`. Key snippet:

```cpp
#include <ESP32_VS1053_Stream.h>
ESP32_VS1053_Stream radio;
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  WiFiManager wm;
  wm.autoConnect("WebRadioAP");
  radio.begin();
  radio.connectStream("http://icecast.example.com:8000/stream");
}
void loop() {
  radio.feedBuffer();
}
```

Hearing the first playback was surreal—my code became audible!

## 4. Advanced Features & Controls

### 4.1 Physical Button Handlers

Instead of polling, I used **attachInterrupt** on rising edges:

| Button | GPIO | Function         |
| ------ | ---- | ---------------- |
| Next   | 14   | Next station     |
| Prev   | 27   | Previous station |
| Up     | 26   | Volume +         |
| Down   | 25   | Volume –         |

```cpp
void IRAM_ATTR nextISR() { stationIndex = (stationIndex + 1) % numStations; }
attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(14), nextISR, RISING);
```

Interrupts prevented missing fast presses.

### 4.2 Tone & Spatialization

Register writes allowed me to tweak EQ:

```cpp
musicPlayer.setTreble(0x0A, -5); // +10 dB treble, -5 dB frequency cutoff
musicPlayer.writeRegister(SCI_MODE, musicPlayer.readRegister(SCI_MODE) | 0x08); // enable spatial
```

Testing different values taught me how subtle register changes shape sound.

### 4.3 Dynamic Wi-Fi with Captive Portal

`WiFiManager` created a hotspot named “WebRadioAP” if no saved networks. The captive portal lets me pick from local Wi-Fi SSIDs—no more recompiling for each network.

## 5. IoT Integration: MQTT Remote Control

### 5.1 MQTT Basics & Topics

I ran a local Mosquitto broker on my laptop and defined topics:

* `radio/command/station`
* `radio/command/volume`
* `radio/status/connected`

Using `PubSubClient`, I implemented callbacks:

```cpp
client.subscribe("radio/command/#");
void callback(char* topic, byte* payload, unsigned int len) {
  // parse payload and adjust station or volume
}
```

### 5.2 Smartphone Dashboard

With **IoT MQTT Panel**, I created:

* **Sliders**: volume (0–100).
* **Buttons**: next/prev station presets.
* **Status light**: green when connected to broker.

Testing on the go was magical—my radio responded instantly to my phone taps.

## 6. Challenges & Learnings

| Challenge                    | Solution                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Audio buffer underrun        | Increased stream buffer to 8 KB, tuned `feedBuffer()` timing. |
| Debouncing button bounces    | Used hardware RC filter + software debounce in ISR.           |
| MQTT reconnect reliability   | Implemented `reconnect()` routine with exponential backoff.   |
| Power consumption on battery | Put ESP32 in light sleep between songs, reduced LED usage.    |

Each hurdle deepened my understanding of embedded systems nuances.

## 7. Future Enhancements

* **OLED Interface**: display station name, signal strength, volume bar.
* **Multi-band Equalizer**: develop a 5-band EQ with interactive UI.
* **Web UI**: serve a HTML/CSS control panel from SPIFFS on the ESP32.
* **SD-Card Playback**: allow offline playback of MP3/WAV files.
* **Battery Gauge**: monitor LiPo voltage and display warnings.

## Conclusion

This project was a turning point in my studies. It bridged theory and practice—forcing me to debug electrical signals, wrestle with buffer limits, and appreciate wireless reliability. Beyond the code and circuits, I gained confidence: I can now conceive, prototype, and refine IoT devices end to end. The simple pleasure of tuning into my own creation’s stations reminds me why I love this field and fuels my excitement for future projects.
