## Introduction

When I first encountered SAE-201, the goal of architecting a multi-VLAN campus network felt like diving into the deep end of networking. I had hands-on experience with routers and switches, but designing a robust topology, subnetting with VLSM, implementing inter-VLAN routing, and deploying services all at once was a new level of complexity. Over several intense lab sessions in GNS3, I moved from basic packet forwarding to a fully segmented, secure network that connected to an external IUT link. Here’s my detailed journey, including insights, hurdles, and what I’ll carry forward.

---

## 1. Project Planning & Topology Design

### 1.1 Defining Requirements

The assignment specifications laid out:

* **Three student VLANs** (Administration, Developers, Administrators) plus a native secure VLAN.
* **Point-to-point links** between routers for dynamic routing (RIP v2).
* **Core services**: HTTP and FTP servers for DEV, PROD, and backup.
* **Security**: port-security on switches; ACLs on R2 and R3.
* **External connectivity**: link to the IUT cloud network.

Breaking down these bullet points helped me draft a logical topology on paper before touching GNS3.

### 1.2 Logical Topology Sketch

I drew three routers (R1, R2, R3) forming a triangle, with R3 linked to a cloud for the IUT. Two distribution switches connected to a central "commutateur-fed" switch. Each server (DEV, PROD, Backup, DHCP) sat in its own VLAN.

This step exposed potential trunk misconfigurations early, saving me troubleshooting time later.

---

## 2. Layer 2 Configuration & VLAN Setup

### 2.1 VLAN Assignment & Trunking

I created VLANs 100 (Admin), 200 (Developers), 300 (Administrators), and 999 (Native). On each switch:

```bash
vlan 100 name ADMIN
vlan 200 name DEV
vlan 300 name ADMN
vlan 999 name NATIVE_SECURE
interface range gi1/0/1-24
  switchport mode access
  switchport access vlan <student-assigned>
interface range gi1/0/25-26
  switchport mode trunk
  switchport trunk native vlan 999
  switchport trunk allowed vlan 100,200,300,999
```

Moving the native VLAN to 999 and tagging it everywhere improved security by avoiding untagged traffic leaks.

### 2.2 Spanning Tree Load Balancing

With three physical trunks between distribution switches and the fed switch, I assigned different port priorities per VLAN:

```bash
spanning-tree vlan 100 port-priority 64
spanning-tree vlan 200 port-priority 128
spanning-tree vlan 300 port-priority 192
```

Thus, if one link failed, STP recalculated roles and evenly distributed VLANs across remaining links.

## 3. IP Addressing & Routing

### 3.1 VLSM Subnetting of 192.168.128.0/20

The /20 block needed slicing into:

* Three VLAN LANs: /29 each (6 usable IPs)
* One Native VLAN: /29
* Four point-to-point links: /30 each

I learned to calculate subnets by hand:

* **192.168.128.0/29** → VLAN 100
* **192.168.128.8/29** → VLAN 200
* **192.168.128.16/29** → VLAN 300
* **192.168.128.24/29** → VLAN 999
* **192.168.128.32/30, /30, /30, /30** → router links

Creating a spreadsheet helped me avoid overlapping ranges.

### 3.2 Configuring SVI & DHCP

On the fed switch:

```bash
interface vlan 100
  ip address 192.168.128.1 255.255.255.248
interface vlan 200
  ip address 192.168.128.9 255.255.255.248
... (and so on)
ip routing
```

I then set up the campus DHCP server with pools matching each VLAN, reserving static IPs for servers. Watching clients grab correct addresses was extremely satisfying.

### 3.3 Dynamic Routing with RIP v2

On R1, R2, R3, I enabled RIP:

```bash
router rip
 version 2
 no auto-summary
 network 192.168.128.0
```

Verifying `show ip route rip` confirmed all subnets propagated across routers.

## 4. Service Deployment

### 4.1 FTP Backup Server

I installed vsftpd on the backup VM and configured:

* **Anonymous read-only** for general access.
* **Local users** (antoine, elise) with write permissions.

Testing with `ftp 192.168.128.25` and uploading logs helped me grasp UNIX permissions and FTP security.

### 4.2 DEV & PROD Web Servers

On DEV, I customized Apache’s `index.html`. On PROD, I automated mirroring:

```bash
rsync -avz --delete dev:/var/www/html/ /var/www/html/
```

Scheduling this via cron ensured the PROD site always reflected the DEV changes.

---

## 5. Security Policies

### 5.1 Switch Port Security

```bash
interface range gi1/0/1-48
 switchport port-security
 switchport port-security maximum 1
 switchport port-security violation restrict
 switchport port-security mac-address sticky
```

Learning port-security prevented unauthorized devices and taught me MAC sticky concepts.

### 5.2 Router ACLs

On R2 (student-to-PROD/Internet) and R3 (IUT-to-campus):

```bash
ip access-list extended STUDENT_FILTER
 permit tcp any any eq 80
 permit tcp any any eq 22
 permit tcp any any eq 873
 deny ip any any
interface gi0/1
 ip access-group STUDENT_FILTER in
```

Troubleshooting ACLs with `show access-lists` highlighted order priorities.

---

## 6. External Connectivity

Using GNS3’s Cloud, I simulated the IUT WAN on R3’s serial interface:

```bash
interface s0/0
 ip address 203.0.113.2 255.255.255.252
 no shutdown
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 s0/0
```

Testing `ping 8.8.8.8` from VLAN hosts through R3 confirmed full Internet reachability.

## 7. Challenges & Lessons Learned

| Challenge                       | Solution & Lesson                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| VLAN misassignment on trunks    | Verified with `show vlan` and trunk status commands.             |
| Overlapping subnets after typo  | Recomputed all ranges in a spreadsheet before applying configs.  |
| RIP incorrect summarization     | Disabled auto-summary to propagate /29 and /30 networks.         |
| FTP permission issues           | Debugged with `chmod` and vsftpd logs for user home directories. |
| ACL blocking legitimate traffic | Used `permit any any` tests, then tightened rules stepwise.      |

Every troubleshooting session reinforced CLI proficiency and methodical debugging.

## 8. Future Improvements

* **Switch-to-switch redundancy**: implement HSRP or VRRP for gateway failover.
* **Advanced routing**: experiment with OSPF for faster convergence.
* **Network monitoring**: deploy SNMP polling and Grafana dashboards.
* **Wireless integration**: add a Wi-Fi AP with controller in the VLAN fabric.

## Conclusion

SAE-201 pushed me to integrate core networking concepts into a cohesive, secure infrastructure. I gained practical skills in VLAN design, VLSM, routing protocols, service deployment, and security policies. More importantly, I developed a systematic approach to planning, implementation, and troubleshooting—skills I’ll carry into real-world network engineering challenges.
