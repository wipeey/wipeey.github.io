## Full-Stack Web Application for Airport Operations

---

### Project Overview

**AeroTrack** is a comprehensive Aviation Traffic Management System developed during my **1st year Bachelor in Computer Science and Networking** as part of the SAE 2.03 curriculum. This project provided an exciting opportunity to build a complete solution for managing airport operations, including runway scheduling, flight coordination, and aircraft tracking.

This was one of my most rewarding projects as it allowed me to **truly understand how databases and web systems work together**, while learning valuable teamwork and collaboration skills in a group development environment.

### Key Features

#### 🛫 Flight Management
- Complete flight scheduling and tracking
- Real-time runway availability checking (10-minute occupancy rule)
- Automated conflict detection with alternative time suggestions
- CSV bulk import for multiple flights with validation

#### ✈️ Aircraft & Airport Management
- Aircraft registry with technical specifications
- Airline company database
- Airport and runway management with capacity constraints
- Image upload system for aircraft types

#### 📊 Reporting & Analytics
- Flight schedule generation for specific airports and date ranges
- PDF export capabilities
- Advanced search and filtering options

### Technical Architecture & Infrastructure

#### Multi-VM Deployment Architecture

The project uses a **two-VM architecture** for production-ready deployment:

**VM-I (Database Server)**
```bash
# System Configuration
NAME: DB
OS: Debian 12 Bookworm
NETINT 1: Bridged (Accès par pont)
NETINT 2: Réseau internet (intnet)
IP ADDRESS: 192.168.0.1/24
```

**VM-II (Web Server)**
```bash
# System Configuration  
NAME: WEB
OS: Debian 12 Bookworm
NETINT: Bridged (Accès par pont)
NETINT 2: Réseau internet (intnet)
IP ADDRESS: 192.168.0.2/24
```

#### Database Setup (MariaDB)

```bash
# MariaDB Installation and Configuration
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client

# Configure database to listen on internal network
nano /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf
# Set bind-address to 192.168.0.1

sudo systemctl restart mariadb
```

#### Web Server Deployment

**Django Environment Setup**
```bash
# System Dependencies
apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip nginx git
apt install pkg-config default-libmysqlclient-dev mariadb-client
apt install python3-full

# Project Deployment
cd /var/www/
sudo git clone https://github.com/wipeey/gestion-trafic-aerien.git
cd gestion-trafic-aerien

# Virtual Environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate --fake-initial
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

**Gunicorn Service Configuration**
```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service
[Unit]
Description=gunicorn daemon
Requires=gunicorn.socket
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=notify
User=toto
Group=toto
RuntimeDirectory=gunicorn
WorkingDirectory=/var/www/gestion-trafic-aerien
ExecStart=/var/www/gestion-trafic-aerien/venv/bin/gunicorn \
    --access-logfile - \
    --workers 3 \
    --bind unix:/run/gunicorn/gunicorn.sock \
    trafic_aerien.wsgi:application
ExecReload=/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID
KillMode=mixed
TimeoutStopSec=5
PrivateTmp=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Nginx Configuration**
```nginx
# /etc/nginx/sites-available/gestion-trafic-aerien
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;
    
    location = /favicon.ico { 
        access_log off; 
        log_not_found off; 
    }
    
    location /static/ {
        root /var/www/gestion-trafic-aerien;
        expires 30d;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
    }
    
    location /media/ {
        root /var/www/gestion-trafic-aerien;
        expires 30d;
        add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
    }
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://unix:/run/gunicorn/gunicorn.sock;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### Database Schema

The system manages six core entities:

```sql
Airports (id, name, country)
├── Runways (number, airport_ref, length)
├── Flights (aircraft, pilot, departure/arrival data)

Airlines (id, name, description, country)
├── Aircraft (id, name, company_ref, type_ref)

Aircraft Types (id, brand, model, image, runway_requirements)
```

### Advanced Business Logic

#### Runway Scheduling Algorithm
- 10-minute runway occupancy enforcement
- Real-time conflict detection for departures and arrivals
- Intelligent time slot suggestions
- Cross-validation between CSV imports and existing flights

### Personal Learning Experience

Working on **AeroTrack** was incredibly rewarding and transformative for my understanding of software development. This project taught me:

#### **Deep Database Understanding**
Rather than just writing SQL queries, I truly grasped how **relational databases work at a fundamental level** - from foreign key relationships to query optimization and data integrity. Setting up MariaDB from scratch and configuring it for multi-server architecture gave me hands-on experience with real-world database administration.

#### **Team Collaboration Skills**
This group project significantly improved my ability to **work effectively in a development team**. I learned valuable lessons about:
- Code collaboration using Git workflows
- Task distribution and project planning
- Communication and problem-solving with teammates
- Code review and quality assurance processes

#### **Systems Integration**
Configuring the multi-VM architecture taught me how different system components communicate and depend on each other, providing invaluable insight into production deployment scenarios.

### Development Challenges Solved

1. **Complex Time Validation**: Implemented sophisticated runway scheduling logic that considers both existing database entries and pending CSV imports
2. **File Upload Management**: Created secure image upload system with validation and storage optimization
3. **Multi-VM Deployment**: Configured secure network communication between database and web servers
4. **User Experience**: Developed intuitive forms with real-time validation and helpful error messages

### Project Impact

**AeroTrack** demonstrates real-world application development skills applicable to aviation industry needs. The project showcases:

- **Scalability**: Multi-server architecture ready for production
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive validation and error handling
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface designed for airport operations staff
- **Maintainability**: Clean code architecture with proper documentation

### Technical Innovation
