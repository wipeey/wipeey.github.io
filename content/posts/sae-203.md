# Aviation Traffic Management System
## Full-Stack Web Application for Airport Operations

---

### Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Aviation Traffic Management System** developed as part of the SAE 2.03 curriculum. The system provides a complete solution for managing airport operations, including runway scheduling, flight coordination, and aircraft tracking.

### Key Features

**🛫 Flight Management**
- Complete flight scheduling and tracking
- Real-time runway availability checking (10-minute occupancy rule)
- Automated conflict detection with alternative time suggestions
- CSV bulk import for multiple flights with validation

**✈️ Aircraft & Airport Management** 
- Aircraft registry with technical specifications
- Airline company database
- Airport and runway management with capacity constraints
- Image upload system for aircraft types

**📊 Reporting & Analytics**
- Flight schedule generation for specific airports and date ranges
- PDF export capabilities
- Advanced search and filtering options

### Technical Architecture

**Backend Infrastructure**
- **Framework**: Django (Python)
- **Database**: MariaDB with optimized queries
- **Web Server**: Nginx + Gunicorn
- **Deployment**: Multi-VM architecture (Database + Web Server)

**Frontend Technologies**
- **UI Framework**: Modern CSS with responsive design
- **Interactive Forms**: Dynamic validation and error handling
- **File Management**: Image upload and processing system

**Infrastructure Setup**
- **VM-I (Database)**: Debian 12, MariaDB Server (192.168.0.1)
- **VM-II (Web Server)**: Debian 12, Django + Nginx (192.168.0.2)
- **Network**: Internal bridge configuration for secure communication

### Database Schema

The system manages six core entities:
```
Airports (id, name, country)
├── Runways (number, airport_ref, length)
├── Flights (aircraft, pilot, departure/arrival data)

Airlines (id, name, description, country)
├── Aircraft (id, name, company_ref, type_ref)

Aircraft Types (id, brand, model, image, runway_requirements)
```

### Advanced Business Logic

**Runway Scheduling Algorithm**
- 10-minute runway occupancy enforcement
- Real-time conflict detection for departures and arrivals
- Intelligent time slot suggestions
- Cross-validation between CSV imports and existing flights

**Data Validation System**
- Runway length compatibility checking
- Time sequence validation (arrival > departure)
- Airport constraint verification
- Bulk data processing with detailed error reporting

### Skills Demonstrated (BUT Competencies)

**AC0311 - System Administration**
- Linux server configuration and maintenance
- Network setup with multiple VMs
- Service management (systemd, nginx, gunicorn)

**AC0312-AC0313 - Programming Excellence**
- Complex Django application development
- Algorithm implementation for scheduling conflicts
- Data validation and error handling
- CSV processing with business rule enforcement

**AC0314 - Web Architecture**
- MVC pattern implementation
- RESTful design principles
- Static file management and media handling
- Responsive UI development

**AC0315 - Database Management**
- Relational database design and optimization
- Complex query optimization
- Data integrity enforcement
- Migration management

**AC0316 - Collaborative Development**
- Git version control workflow
- Modular code architecture
- Documentation and deployment procedures
- Multi-environment configuration

### Development Challenges Solved

1. **Complex Time Validation**: Implemented sophisticated runway scheduling logic that considers both existing database entries and pending CSV imports
2. **File Upload Management**: Created secure image upload system with validation and storage optimization
3. **Multi-VM Deployment**: Configured secure network communication between database and web servers
4. **User Experience**: Developed intuitive forms with real-time validation and helpful error messages

### Project Impact

This system demonstrates real-world application development skills applicable to aviation industry needs. The project showcases:
- **Scalability**: Multi-server architecture ready for production
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive validation and error handling
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface designed for airport operations staff
- **Maintainability**: Clean code architecture with proper documentation

### Technical Innovation

The runway scheduling algorithm represents a novel approach to resource management, automatically detecting conflicts and suggesting optimal alternatives. This feature could significantly improve airport operational efficiency in real-world applications.
